# Greekpany

Greekpany is a small example project. The repository includes SQL scripts for creating and populating tables, a dbt project and a sample Power BI dashboard.

## Running the SQL scripts

1. Use MySQL to create a database. You can run `scripts/setup.sql` which creates the `greekpany` database.
2. Execute `scripts/create_tables.sql` to create the tables.
3. Load the sample data by running the scripts from the `scripts` folder.
